                <p>I'm Dani Vijay. A Professional Full Stack Web Dev from Gods own Country, Kerala. Expertise in JavaScript, PHP, mySQL, AJAX, JSON, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery..

        Being up to date in technology is what inspires me and drives me (crazy?). Doing hands on and pushing the possibilities to it's limits is the only thing that satisfies me.

        I just love to spend free time on making my works perfect. Which guarantees performance at its peek. I value the satisfaction of end user and achieves it by polishing the products. Learning capacity is my primary strength IMHO.<p>
